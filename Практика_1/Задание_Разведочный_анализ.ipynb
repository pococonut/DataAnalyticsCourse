        "5.   Первый ящик с усами (boxplot) получился пустым из-за наличия пустых значений в данных. Для последующего анализа данные необходимо очистить от пропущенных значений. После удаления пустых значений мы получили ящик с усами (boxplot). Полученный ящик имеет небольшой межквартильный диапазон, то есть показатели сосредоточены в узком диапазоне значений. Медиана смещена к нижней части ящика, это говорит о том, что большая часть данных сосредоточена в нижней части диапазона. У ящика короткие усы, что говорит о том, что значения за пределами первого и третьего квартилей находятся в узком диапазоне. Множество точек за пределами усов указывает на наличие значительных отклонений от основной массы данных. Гистограма показывает, что большая часть данных имеет значение до 200 миллионов долларов. Чем больше показатель gross_earn, тем меньше фильмов ему соответствует."
